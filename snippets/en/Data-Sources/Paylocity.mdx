## Prerequisites

Before you can authenticate to Paylocity via OAuth, you must first obtain API access and register your desired callback URL with Paylocity. The callback URL for Connect AI is *https://oauth.cdata.com/oauth/*.

To register, contact either service@paylocity.com or sales@paylocity.com.

Once your access has been reviewed and approved, Paylocity provides you with OAuth credentials and access to either a Sandbox or a Production account. This access is necessary for authenticating your API requests.

Paylocity provides the following OAuth credentials.

- **client\_id**: The client\_id assigned to the registered OAuth application in the Paylocity developer portal. This value is used to set the **OAuthClientId**.
- **secret**: The secret assigned to the registered OAuth application in the Paylocity developer portal. This value is used to set the **OAuthClientSecret**. Note that Paylocity requires secrets to be rotated every 365 days. They send an email reminder of your secret expiring at 10 days before expiration and again at 5 days before expiration.
