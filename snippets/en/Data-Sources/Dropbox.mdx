<Note>
The directions above assume you are using CData's embedded OAuth app. If you want to create a custom OAuth app, see [Creating a Custom OAuth App](https://cdn.cdata.com/help/OFM/cloud/default.htm#pg_oauthcustomappcreate). After you have created a custom OAuth app, go to the **Advanced Settings** tab and enter the **OAuth Client Id** and **OAuth Client Secret** you obtained from the custom OAuth app.
