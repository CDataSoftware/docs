## REST API

Embedded Cloud provides a full-featured [REST API](/en/API/REST-API) that allows any REST-compatible application or integration tool capable of creating HTTP requests to query data, perform batch query operations, and execute stored procedures across all data sources configured in your account. This API is based on a JSON-formatted API.
