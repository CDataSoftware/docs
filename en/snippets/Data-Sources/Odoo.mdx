## Prerequisites

Connect AI may be able to detect the Odoo database name automatically from the web address. However, we recommend that you specify the name of the Odoo database and enter it in the **Database** field.

To find your Odoo database name:

<Steps>
<Step>
Log into your Odoo Online account.
</Step>
<Step>
Click your profile icon in the top-right corner and choose **My Databases**. Your database name is listed in the table.
</Step>
</Steps>

Alternatively, you can often see the database name in the subdomain of your URL. If your URL is `https://mycompany.odoo.com`, your database name is likely `mycompany`.
