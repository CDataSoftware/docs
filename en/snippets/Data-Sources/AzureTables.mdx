Enter the following information:
	- **Shared Access Signature**—a valid signature of a resource to connect to. This signature may be generated with a tool such as Azure Storage Explorer. See [Microsoft's help page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) for more information about shared access signatures.
	- **Account**—the Azure Storage account name. To access your Azure storage accounts or create one, log in to the Azure portal and click **Storage Accounts** in the services menu on the left. If the backend is set to **AzureStack**, set the Account as the complete host for your data. For example: `<account>.nm.azs.sandia.gov`. If the backend is set to **Emulator**, set the Account as the complete host. For example: `http://127.0.0.1:10002/devstoreaccount1`.
	- **Backend**—select the backend from the drop-down list. The backend is where the data is stored. Data may retrieved from the classic Azure Table Storage repository (**Storage**, the default), Azure Storage Emulator, CosmosDB, or Azure Stack Hub.
