## Prerequisites

#### Whitelist CData IPs

To establish a connection to MariaDB, you need to allow access to MariaDB via CData’s IP. When hosting MariaDB behind a firewall, you must safelist these IP addresses in your firewall.

- Range: `52.224.0.160` to `52.224.0.175` and `4.154.117.160` to `4.154.117.175`.
- CIDR notation: `52.224.0.160/28` and `4.154.117.160/28`

#### Ensure MariaDB Is Publicly Accessible

Provide a public facing IP/domain to connect to this data source. The following private IP ranges do not work:

- `10.0.0.0` to `10.255.255.255`
- `172.16.0.0` to `172.31.255.255`
- `192.168.0.0` to `192.168.255.255`
- `127.0.0.1` (aka ‘localhost’)
