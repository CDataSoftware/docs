## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Cursor with Connect AI, you must first do the following:

- Install the Cursor IDE.

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/en/Sources) for more information.

- Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT) on the [Settings](/en/Settings#access-tokens) page. Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

- Base64-encode your Connect AI credentials in the following format: `Base64("email:PAT")`.

## Connect Cursor to the Connect AI MCP

<Steps>
<Step>
In the Cursor IDE, go to **Cursor Settings**. Then click **Tools & MCP**, and then click **New MCP Server.** The file `mcp.json` opens automatically in the Cursor IDE.
</Step>

<Step>
Copy and paste the following into the `mcp.json` file. Replace the authorization header with the Base64-encoded credentials obtained in the prerequisites.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cdata-mcp": {
      "url": "https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_EMAIL:PAT" //Authorization obtained in prerequisites
      }
    }
  }
}
```
</Step>

<Step>
Return to **Tools & MCP** under **Cursor Settings**. Confirm that Cursor is connected to CData's MCP Server. You should see **cdata-mcp** listed with a green indicator.

<Step>
You can now chat with the assistant. Cursor lists the available tools, the connections, and a result set of a given table of a given connection. By default, Cursor asks for confirmation before executing MCP tool actions.
