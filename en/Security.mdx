## Security Kit

The Connect AI [Security Kit](https://www.cdata.com/security/) includes architecture documentation, security policies, and data retention policies.

## Rate Limits

The Connect AI rate limit is 100 requests per user per minute. This limit is shared across all data sources, so if a user issues 70 requests in a minute to one connection, that user can only issue 30 more requests to another connection in the same minute. Note that requests with excessively long response times might time out. If your request times out, please refine the query to reduce the time it takes to execute.

## IP Allowlist

Connect AI uses a range of static IP addresses to communicate with external data sources. To ensure that you can access your data, you must allow these static IP addresses in your data sources. The table below lists these IP addresses.

| IP Addresses (CIDR) | IP Addresses (Range) |
	|:--- |:--- |
