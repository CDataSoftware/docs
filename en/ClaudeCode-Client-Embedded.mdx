## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Claude Code with Embedded Cloud, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/en/Sources-Embedded) for more information.

Generate an [OAuth JWT bearer token](/en/API/Authentication-Embedded). Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

## Connect Claude Code to the Connect AI MCP
<Steps>
<Step>
Open PowerShell as an Administrator and run the following command:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```
</Step>
<Step>
Once the installation is done, try running the following command in your terminal to confirm the installation:

```bash
npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

You should see something like this:

```bash
C:\Users\ConnectAIUser\AppData\Roaming\npm\
`-- @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.0.28
```
</Step>
<Step>
Create a project named `Claude code` and open it in Visual Studio Code.
</Step>
<Step>
In the terminal of your project, run the following command. Note that Embedded Cloud customers should use an authorization header of `Bearer {Your_OAuth_JWT_Token}`.

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http connectmcp https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp --header "Authorization: Basic {Your_Base64Encoded_EMAIL:PAT}"
```

This creates a JSON file with your MCP Server.
</Step>
<Step>
Type:

```bash
claude
```

A welcome screen appears:

  <img src="./images/claudecode_client_welcome.png" alt="Claude Code Client Welcome" />
</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Choose a text style and login method. Claude Code opens the browser to log in to Claude.
</Step>
<Step>
You can now interact with the MCP server:
