## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Gemini with Connect AI, you must first connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/ja/Sources-Embedded) for more information.

Generate an [OAuth JWT bearer token](/ja/Authentication-Embedded). Copy this down, as it acts as your password during authentication.

You need Python >= 3.10 to use the Gemini tools.

## Connect through the Gemini Command Line Interface

After you install Gemini, do the following:
<Steps>
<Step>
Go to your user directory `%USERPROFILE%` and create a `.gemini` folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Within the folder, create a file named `settings.json`.
</Step>
<Step>
Copy and paste the following into the `settings.json` file. `"Authorization"` should be set to `"Bearer OAUTH_JWT_TOKEN"`. This is the OAuth JWT token from the prerequisites.

```json
{
"mcpServers": {
   "connect-cloud": {
      "httpUrl": "https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer OAUTH_JWT_TOKEN"  //Replace with your OAuth JWT Token
     },
      "trust": true
   }
 },
"selectedAuthType": "oauth-personal"
}
```
</Step>
<Step>
In the terminal, type:

```bash
gemini
```

You may need to give Google authorization to access your account.
</Step>
<Step>
The Gemini screen appears as follows:

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a prompt in the prompt box to ask Gemini a question. Gemini uses the Connect AI tools such as `getCatalogs`, `getSchemas`, and `getTables` to retrieve data from connected data sources.
</Step>
<Step>
Gemini returns a response to your prompt.

</Steps>

## Connect through the Google ADK
<Steps>
<Step>
Download the folder [adk-mcp-client](https://github.com/CDataSoftware/adk-mcp-client) and unzip the folder.
</Step>
<Step>
Rename `.env example` to `.env`.
</Step>
<Step>
In the `.env` file, remove `MCP_USERNAME` and `MCP_PASSWORD`. You are using the OAuth JWT token from the prerequisites to authenticate.
</Step>
<Step>
Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
</Step>
<Step>
Run the following command. This starts the ADK at port 5000 on your local machine:

```bash
python -m google.adk.cli web --port 5000
```
</Step>
<Step>
In your web browser, open `127.0.0.1:5000`. The application looks like the following:

</Frame>
</Step>
<Step>
Enter a prompt in the **Type a Message** box. Gemini uses the Connect AI tools such as `getCatalogs`, `getSchemas`, and `getTables` to retrieve data from connected data sources.
