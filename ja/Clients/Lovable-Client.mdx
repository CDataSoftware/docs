## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use Lovable with Connect AI, you must first do the following:

- Ensure you are on a Business or Enterprise plan with Lovable. 

- Connect a data source to your Connect AI account. See [Sources](/ja/Sources) for more information.

## Connect Lovable to the Connect AI MCP

</Step>

<Step>
Enter the following setup details:
- **Server Name**–enter your user-defined server name, such as *Custom MCP server*.
- **Server URL**–enter *https://mcp.cloud.cdata.com/mcp*.
- **Authentication**–select **OAuth**.
</Step>

<Step>
Authenticate using your CData Connect AI account email (such as user@cdata.com) and password. Once authentication is successful, your available CData connectors appear in the connectors list.

</Step>

<Step>
You can now run a test prompt to make sure Lovable is successfully communicating with the CData MCP Server. For example, enter the prompt ***List all MCP tools.*** The output returns a list of tools, such as `getCatalogs`, `queryData`, and others.
</Step>

<Step>
You can now query your connected data source(s) in Connect AI using natural language prompts, such as ***Get all data from the Dnd table from the Slack connection*** or ***Get the top 10 records from the Automations table from the MailChimp connection***.
