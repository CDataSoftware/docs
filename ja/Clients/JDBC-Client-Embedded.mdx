## Prerequisites

Before you can configure and use JDBC with Embedded Cloud, you must first connect a data source to your account. See [Sources](Sources-Embedded) for more information.

## Install the Driver

Download and run the JDBC setup file for your operating system.

- [Windows Download](https://jp.cdata.com/download/getfile.aspx?file=free/LFRK-V/setup.exe&name=CData%20Connect%20JDBC%20Driver&tag=Download-connect)

## Create a JDBC Data Source

Follow these steps to create a JDBC data source to connect to Embedded Cloud from your Java application:
<Steps>
<Step>
Add the driver JAR file to the classpath. The JAR file is located in the `lib` subfolder of the JDBC driver for Connect AI installation directory.

<Note>
**Note:** The .lic file must be located in the same folder as the JAR file.
</Note>
</Step>
<Step>
Some applications automatically populate the driver class. For applications that do not automatically populate it, you must enter it manually. For example:

```bash
cdata.jdbc.connect.ConnectDriver
```
</Step>
<Step>
Provide the JDBC URL. For example:

```bash
jdbc:connect:AuthScheme=OAuth;
```

or

```bash
jdbc:cdata:connect:AuthScheme=OAuth;
```
	The second format above can be used to ensure you are using the CData driver whenever there is a conflict in your application between drivers using the same URL format. The URL must start with either `jdbc:connect:` or `jdbc:cdata:connect:`, and it must only include the AuthScheme setting as OAuth.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Designate a Log File

You can designate a log file for the JDBC driver in the **Advanced** tab of **Connection Properties**. You can also change the verbosity of the log file for greater detail.
