## User-Authenticated Connections

By default, all connections share one set of service credentials on the **Add/Edit Connection** page. However, you can configure a connection so that each user has unique credentials for that connection, ensuring that source roles and permissions are enforced on the data.

## Table Access

You can control access to the tables in Connect AI at the source or workspace level, as explained below.

### On the Edit/Add Connection Page

Note that in the **Permissions** tab of the connection only allows you to edit the permissions at the connection level. To edit permissions at the workspace level, go to the **Users** page.

When you create or edit a connection, the **Permissions** tab displays a list of available users and allows you to assign permissions to each one. Permissions are described in the list below:

- **Select:** Enables the user to select rows from tables in a connection.  
- **Insert:** Enables the user to insert rows into tables of a connection.
- **Update:** Enables the user to update rows in tables of a connection.
- **Delete:** Enables the user to delete rows from tables in a connection.
- **Execute:** Enables users to execute stored procedures in a connection.

You can toggle the permissions in two ways:

- Click an individual box to enable a permission for a single user.
- Click the top of a table column to toggle that permission for every user.
