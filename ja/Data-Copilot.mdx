## Prerequisites

In order to use the Connect AI Data Copilot, you must have at least one data connection, and you must have the necessary permissions to that connection.

## Connect to Your Data

Connect AI's Data Copilot uses Azure OpenAI as an LLM. It allows you to connect to the remote MCP server and obtain insights from your data in real time without a third-party integration tool. Simply add a prompt in the text box and click **Submit**. The Data Copilot welcome page provides some sample prompts. For a more complete list of prompt ideas, see the CData [prompt library](https://www.cdata.com/ai/prompt-library/). You can filter prompts by data source.

Once you submit a prompt, the remote MCP server works to access the relevant catalogs, schemas, and tables. The Data Copilot may prompt you for more information to narrow down the data you need. Expand the results of each tool (such as `getCatalogs`, `getSchemas` or `getTables`) to obtain details about how the tool accessed the data. Click **Reset Chat** to clear the screeen.

## Save Your Prompt

Prompts are saved for 30 days so you can return to them later. Click the three dots to the right to rename your prompt or delete it permanently.
