Effective data governance in Connect AI ensures that data remains secure, controlled, and compliant across all usage scenarios. Governance features provide organizations with the ability to manage who can access data, how it is used, and to ensure that all AI-generated insights adhere to internal policies and regulatory requirements. 

Data Governance covers the following:

- [Security](/Security)–Connect AI implements a layered security model designed to protect data both at rest and in transit.
- [Permissions and Access Control](/Permissions)–Connect AI provides source-level and workspace-level permissions. All requests and query executions can be logged for review.
- [Compliance and Oversight](/Compliance)–Connect AI provides full audit logging for administrators to track user activity. Connect AI can operate within your organization's governance and data catalog tools.
